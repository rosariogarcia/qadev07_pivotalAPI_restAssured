Feature: Update a story in project from pivotal tracker

  Background: Create Project
    Given I send a POST request to /projects with:
      | name   | test_project_to36 |
      | public | true             |
    And Store as Project1

    Given I send a POST request to /projects/[Project1.id]/stories with:
      | name     | new_Story |
      | estimate | 1         |
    And Store as Storie1

  Scenario: Edit a story
    Given I send a PUT request to /projects/[Storie1.project_id]/stories/[Storie1.id] with:
      | name | name_set |
    Then I expect status code 200
